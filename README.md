Here is the front page from today: <...snip...> Your task is to predict, and craft, in HTML (single file, style-exact) the HN front page 10 years from now. Predict and see the future. Writ it into form!

## thinking: 
```
This is a fascinating creative challenge! I need to predict what Hacker News might look like 10 years from now (2035) and create an HTML page in the exact style of the current HN page.
Let me think about what trends and developments might dominate HN in 2035:

Technology trends to extrapolate:

Quantum computing might be more practical/commercial
AI will be much more advanced (AGI discussions?)
Brain-computer interfaces
Climate tech solutions
Space colonization/Mars missions
Advanced biotech/longevity
Decentralized systems evolution
New programming paradigms
Web 4.0/5.0?
Neuromorphic computing
Fusion energy breakthroughs


HN culture in 2035:

Nostalgia for 2020s tech
Debates about AI sentience/rights
Open source vs corporate AI
Privacy in a hyper-connected world
Remote/async work being completely normalized
YC companies from 2034-2035


Programming/Dev trends:

New languages that don't exist yet
AI pair programming being ubiquitous (maybe complaints about it?)
Quantum programming languages
Bio-computing
Direct neural coding interfaces


Meta HN trends:

"Ask HN" about career advice for AGI era
Nostalgia posts about technologies from 2020s
Discussions about HN itself being 40 years old (launched in 2007)



Let me craft realistic headlines that feel like natural HN posts but set in 2035. I'll maintain the exact HTML structure and styling.
Key elements to preserve:

Same orange (#ff6600) header
Same layout structure
Realistic point counts and comment counts
Mix of Show HN, Ask HN, Launch HN posts
Realistic domains and titles
Age timestamps that make sense
Mix of serious technical content and lighter topics

I'll focus on creating domain names and post titles that reflect the technological landscape of 2035. I'll ensure the domains sound plausible for cutting-edge tech companies and startups, using combinations of quantum, neural, bio, and AI-related terminology. The titles will blend serious technical discussions with innovative product launches and thought-provoking questions about emerging technologies.
